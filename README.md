# John Lewis Coding Challenge - Shopopoly

Creating a Monopoly-style game.

## Part 1 - create Location data type

Task is to create a `Location` data type, which can represent "Go", "Free
Parking", a factory/warehouse, or a retail site, all of which have certain
properties or conditions. The data type should prevent creation of invalid
locations as far as possible.

## Part 2 - create GameLedger

The game ledger will keep records of who paid who how much money, who bought
what, and who developed what property. Later we will query the ledger to find
out things like who owns what location and how much money the players have.

## Part 3 - create Player and Dice datatypes

We want to roll the dice, move the player, and know if they've passed Go.
